Hybrid machine learning models combine multiple algorithms to harness their unique strengths, leading to improved predictive performance and robustness. In this article, I take you through a step-by-step guide on building a hybrid model using LightGBM (LGBM) and Random Forest (RF)—two of the most powerful ensemble learning techniques.

By combining LGBM's speed and efficiency with Random Forest's stability and interpretability, our model delivers superior results, achieving the best R² score and lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This approach is especially useful for handling complex datasets with both linear and non-linear relationships.
